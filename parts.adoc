= Parts list

- Haya HB83 shortboard (made by @bevilacqua) , because my friend wanted a small board
- 10s5p 30Q battery (cells from @PowadangaBoi), to maximize range, while being 10s for safety
- Bestech D596 80A BMS from @BigBen, to omit having an anti-spark
- Focbox ESC. Original plan was a cheap TB one (hence 10s), but focbox fit better, and this build deserves it.
- Caliber II trucks, because they were cheap. The color matches the deck perfectly.
- Kyro soft angled risers for stability
- Evolve 97mm GTR wheels, because of the color scheme
- Abec wheel pulley from @ShawnyP
- Maytech 6374 150kv motor from @seaborder for dirt cheap (unsensored)
- @Boardnamics mount with idler (replaced)
- Nano X remote (from @Moros), because it easily fits in your pocket, and is quite reliable
- Metr Pro module
